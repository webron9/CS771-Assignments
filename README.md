# CS771-Assignments

### Assignment 1
#### XOR-PUF Response Predictor
- Developed a novel to enhance the understanding of XOR-PUF (Physically Unclonable Function) systems.
- Formed this problem as a linear regression challenge, utilizing mathematical derivations and machine learning techniques to predict individual PUF outputs within the XOR-PUF architecture.
- Implemented linear rregression algorithm from scratch for better understanding of algorithm. 

### Assignment 2
#### The Code Corrector
- Explored diverse classification methods including Logistic Regression (OvA), LWP, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- Opted for Logistic Regression (OvA) due to robustness in handling imbalanced data, yielding competitive accuracy.
- Mitigated imbalanced data challenge through class weight experimentation, significantly enhancing macro precision, especially for minority classes.
- Employed advanced techniques like SMOTE and Hybrid Sampling for further performance enhancement, achieving impressive macro precision 
- Conducted thorough hyperparameter tuning via grid search, resulting in finely optimized model parameters.

### Assignment 3
#### DeCaptcha
- Employed advanced techniques for precise background removal, enhancing image focus.
- Applied erosion and dilation filters with carefully selected parameters for improved image quality.
- Expertly segmented characters through precise cropping and converted RGB to grayscale.
- Transformed string labels to integers using LabelEncoder, followed by one-hot encoding for enhanced data representation.
